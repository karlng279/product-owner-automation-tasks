# Codebase Framework

## Overview

The **Codebase Framework** provides templates, patterns, and standards for implementing features based on design specifications. It bridges the gap between design specs and code implementation.

**Status:** 🚧 Placeholder - In Development

---

## Purpose

This framework will contain:
- Technical architecture templates
- Code structure guidelines
- Component implementation patterns
- State management standards
- API integration patterns
- Testing standards and examples

---

## Planned Structure

```

└── templates/                  # Code templates
```

## Integration with Design Framework

The Codebase Framework takes design specifications as input:

```
Design Framework Output → Codebase Framework Input
Component Specs (COMP-XXX) → Component Implementation
Interactions (INT-XXX) → State Management + Event Handlers
Table Specs (TBL-XXX) → Tanstack Table Implementation
```

## Coming Soon

This framework is currently a placeholder. The following will be added:

### 1. Project Structure
- [ ] Folder organization standards
- [ ] File naming conventions
- [ ] Module structure guidelines

### 2. Component Patterns
- [ ] ShadCN UI implementation patterns
- [ ] Component composition guidelines
- [ ] Props and state management
- [ ] Accessibility implementation

### 3. State Management
- [ ] React Context patterns
- [ ] State management library guides (Zustand, Redux)
- [ ] Server state management (React Query, SWR)
- [ ] Form state management

### 4. API Patterns
- [ ] REST API integration
- [ ] GraphQL patterns
- [ ] Error handling
- [ ] Loading states
- [ ] Caching strategies

### 5. Testing Patterns
- [ ] Unit testing with Vitest/Jest
- [ ] Component testing with Testing Library
- [ ] Integration testing
- [ ] E2E testing with Playwright/Cypress
- [ ] Test data patterns

### 6. Templates
- [ ] Component templates
- [ ] Hook templates
