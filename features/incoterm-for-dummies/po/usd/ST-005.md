**USL Reference:** [ST-005 in usl.md](../usl.md#st-005-understand-buyer-seller-responsibilities)
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-23

## UI Elements

- **AC-001:** Responsibility section displays a two-column layout: "Seller's Responsibilities" and "Buyer's Responsibilities".
- **AC-002:** Each responsibility list shows categorized items:
  - Costs (what each party pays for)
  - Risks (what each party is liable for)
  - Tasks (what each party must do)
- **AC-003:** Each responsibility item has a checkbox-style icon (for visual clarity, not interactive).
- **AC-004:** Section header shows "Who is Responsible for What?".
- **AC-005:** A summary banner at the top shows the key takeaway: "Seller responsible until [point]".

---

## UI Behavior

- **AC-006:** Clicking a category header (Costs/Risks/Tasks) expands or collapses that section (accordion style).
- **AC-007:** By default, all sections are expanded on desktop, collapsed on mobile.
- **AC-008:** Items have subtle hover effect on desktop.

---

## Logic

- **AC-009:** Responsibility data is specific to each Incoterm (loaded from static JSON).
- **AC-010:** If a responsibility does not apply (e.g., insurance for FOB), it is not shown rather than marked N/A.

---

## Special Notes

- **AC-011:** Use clear, action-oriented language: "Arrange main transport" not "Main transport arrangement".
- **AC-012:** Include a "Did you know?" callout with a practical tip related to responsibilities.
- **AC-013:** Add a "Common confusion" note if this Incoterm is often misunderstood.

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-001:** Section renders within 200ms.
- **NFR-002:** Content is accessible via keyboard navigation (Tab through sections).
