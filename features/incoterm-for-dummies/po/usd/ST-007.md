## UI Elements

- **AC-001:** Question page displays current question number and total (e.g., "Question 3 of 10").
- **AC-002:** Progress bar shows visual indication of quiz completion percentage.
- **AC-003:** Question text is displayed prominently.
- **AC-004:** Four answer options are displayed as clickable cards/buttons (A, B, C, D).
- **AC-005:** "Next Question" button appears after an answer is selected.
- **AC-006:** "Previous Question" button allows going back to review (optional, can be disabled).

---

## UI Behavior

- **AC-007:** Clicking an answer option visually highlights it as selected.
- **AC-008:** Only one answer can be selected at a time; clicking another deselects the previous.
- **AC-009:** "Next Question" button is disabled until an answer is selected.
- **AC-010:** After selecting answer, immediate feedback shows if correct/incorrect (with color coding).
- **AC-011:** If incorrect, the correct answer is highlighted in green.

---

## Logic

- **AC-012:** User's selected answer is stored in local state for results calculation.
- **AC-013:** Questions follow the randomized order set at quiz start.
- **AC-014:** If user refreshes page mid-quiz, quiz restarts from beginning (no persistence).

---

## Special Notes

- **AC-015:** Question text and options are large enough for easy reading (min 16px body text).
- **AC-016:** Keyboard navigation: 1/2/3/4 keys select options A/B/C/D, Enter confirms.
- **AC-017:** On mobile, answer cards stack vertically with full width.

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-001:** Transition between questions takes less than 200ms.
- **NFR-002:** State updates (answer selection) are instant (<50ms perceived).
