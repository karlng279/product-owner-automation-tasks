## UI Elements

- **AC-001:** Results page displays overall score prominently (e.g., "8 out of 10 correct - 80%").
- **AC-002:** Score is accompanied by a performance message:
  - 90-100%: "Excellent! You're an Incoterms expert!"
  - 70-89%: "Great job! You have a solid understanding."
  - 50-69%: "Good effort! Review the topics below to improve."
  - Below 50%: "Keep learning! Check out our educational content."
- **AC-003:** Visual score indicator (progress ring, bar, or similar) shows percentage graphically.
- **AC-004:** "Review Answers" section shows list of all questions with:
  - Question text (summarized)
  - User's answer (marked correct in green or incorrect in red)
  - Correct answer (if user was wrong)
  - "Learn more" link to relevant Incoterm detail page
- **AC-005:** "Retake Quiz" button to start over.
- **AC-006:** "Back to Home" button to return to landing page.

---

## UI Behavior

- **AC-007:** Questions in review section are collapsed by default; clicking expands to show full question and explanation.
- **AC-008:** Incorrect answers are shown first in the review section (sorted by incorrect first).
- **AC-009:** Clicking "Learn more" opens Incoterm detail page in same tab.

---

## Logic

- **AC-010:** Score is calculated as: (correct answers / total questions) * 100.
- **AC-011:** Results are calculated client-side from stored quiz state.
- **AC-012:** "Retake Quiz" clears previous answers and randomizes questions again.

---

## Special Notes

- **AC-013:** Share results feature (optional): "Share your score" generates a shareable text/image.
- **AC-014:** Include encouraging message regardless of score to maintain positive learning experience.
- **AC-015:** Explanations for wrong answers should be educational, not just "The answer was X".

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-001:** Results page loads within 500ms after completing last question.
- **NFR-002:** Score animation (if any) completes within 1 second.
