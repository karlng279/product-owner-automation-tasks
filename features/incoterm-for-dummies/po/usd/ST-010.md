**USL Reference:** [ST-010 in usl.md](../usl.md#st-010-view-quick-reference-card)
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-23

---

## UI Elements

- **AC-001:** Reference page displays all 11 Incoterms as compact reference cards.
- **AC-002:** Each reference card shows:
  - Incoterm code (large, prominent)
  - Full name
  - Transport mode icon
  - Risk transfer point (one line)
  - Cost transfer point (one line)
  - One-sentence summary
- **AC-003:** Cards are organized in a responsive grid layout.
- **AC-004:** Page header shows "Incoterms Quick Reference".
- **AC-005:** Filter buttons allow filtering by transport mode (All, Sea Only, Any Mode).

---

## UI Behavior

- **AC-006:** Clicking a card expands it to show additional details inline (or opens a modal).
- **AC-007:** Clicking "View Full Details" link on expanded card navigates to detail page.
- **AC-008:** Filter buttons toggle active state; only one can be active at a time.
- **AC-009:** Filtering animates cards in/out smoothly.

---

## Logic

- **AC-010:** Reference data is loaded from static JSON.
- **AC-011:** Filtering by "Sea Only" shows: FAS, FOB, CFR, CIF.
- **AC-012:** Filtering by "Any Mode" shows: EXW, FCA, CPT, CIP, DAP, DPU, DDP.
- **AC-013:** "All" filter shows all 11 Incoterms.

---

## Special Notes

- **AC-014:** Reference cards are optimized for quick scanning - minimal text, high contrast.
- **AC-015:** Cards maintain consistent height within each row.
- **AC-016:** On mobile, cards display as a vertical list for easier reading.

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-001:** Reference page loads within 500ms.
- **NFR-002:** Filter transition animation completes within 300ms.
