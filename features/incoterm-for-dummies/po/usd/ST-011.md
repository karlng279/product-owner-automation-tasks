## UI Elements

- **AC-001:** Comparison page displays "Compare Incoterms" as the page title.
- **AC-002:** Selection area shows all 11 Incoterms as selectable chips/buttons.
- **AC-003:** Each chip displays the Incoterm code and has a checkbox indicator.
- **AC-004:** Selected chips are visually highlighted (different background color, checkmark).
- **AC-005:** Counter shows "X of 3 selected" to indicate selection status.
- **AC-006:** "Compare Now" button is displayed below the selection area.
- **AC-007:** Instructions text explains: "Select 2-3 Incoterms to compare side-by-side".

---

## UI Behavior

- **AC-008:** Clicking an unselected chip selects it (adds to comparison).
- **AC-009:** Clicking a selected chip deselects it (removes from comparison).
- **AC-010:** Maximum 3 Incoterms can be selected; attempting to select a 4th shows a tooltip/message.
- **AC-011:** "Compare Now" button is disabled until at least 2 Incoterms are selected.
- **AC-012:** Clicking "Compare Now" navigates to the comparison view with selected Incoterms.

---

## Logic

- **AC-013:** Selection state is stored in URL query parameters (e.g., ?compare=fob,cif,exw).
- **AC-014:** If URL has valid compare params on page load, those Incoterms are pre-selected.
- **AC-015:** Invalid Incoterm codes in URL are ignored.

---

## Special Notes

- **AC-016:** Quick-select presets are available: "Common Sea Terms (FOB vs CIF)" , "Ex Works vs Delivered (EXW vs DDP)".
- **AC-017:** Clicking a preset auto-selects those Incoterms.
- **AC-018:** Selection chips are keyboard navigable (Tab, Space to select).

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-001:** Selection state updates are instant (<50ms).
- **NFR-002:** Page is shareable via URL with selections encoded.
