## UI Elements

- **AC-001:** Wizard landing page displays "Find the Right Incoterm" as title.
- **AC-002:** Page shows a brief explanation: "Answer a few questions about your shipping situation and we'll suggest the best Incoterms for you."
- **AC-003:** Estimated time indicator shows "Takes about 2 minutes".
- **AC-004:** "Start Wizard" button is prominently displayed.
- **AC-005:** Visual step indicator shows wizard has 4-5 steps.

---

## UI Behavior

- **AC-007:** Progress indicator updates as user advances through questions.
- **AC-008:** "Back" button available to return to previous question (after first question).

---

## Logic

---

## Special Notes

- **AC-011:** Include a "Not sure? Learn more first" link to the educational section.
