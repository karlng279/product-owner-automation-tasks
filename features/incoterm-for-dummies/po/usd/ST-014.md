## UI Elements

  - Question number and progress (e.g., "Step 2 of 5")
  - Progress bar
  - Question text in plain language
  - Answer options as large, clickable cards
- **AC-002:** Questions cover the following scenarios:
  - Q1: Mode of transport (Sea/Ocean, Air, Road/Rail, Multiple modes)
  - Q2: Who arranges main transport (Seller, Buyer, Not sure)
  - Q3: Who arranges export customs (Seller, Buyer, Not sure)
  - Q4: Do you need seller to provide insurance (Yes, No, Not sure)
  - Q5: Where should risk transfer (At origin, During transit, At destination)
- **AC-003:** Each answer option has a brief explanation below it.
- **AC-004:** "Help me understand" expandable section for complex questions.
- **AC-005:** "Back" button to go to previous question.
- **AC-006:** "Next" button to proceed (enabled after selection).

---

## UI Behavior

- **AC-007:** Clicking an answer option selects it (visual highlight).
- **AC-008:** Only one answer can be selected per question.
- **AC-009:** Clicking "Next" with a selection proceeds to next question.
- **AC-010:** Clicking "Next" on last question proceeds to results.
- **AC-011:** Clicking "Back" preserves previous selections.

---

## Logic

- **AC-012:** User answers are stored in wizard context state.
- **AC-013:** "Not sure" answers are treated as neutral (don't eliminate options).
- **AC-014:** Answer combinations map to a scoring system for Incoterm recommendations.

---

## Special Notes

- **AC-015:** Questions adapt based on previous answers (e.g., skip sea-only questions if "Air" selected).
- **AC-016:** Animated transitions between questions (slide effect).
- **AC-017:** Accessible: screen reader announces question changes.

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-001:** Question transition takes less than 300ms.
- **NFR-002:** Selection state update is instant (<50ms).
