**USL Reference:** [ST-015 in usl.md](../usl.md#st-015-view-incoterm-recommendations)
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-23

---

## UI Elements

- **AC-001:** Results page displays "Recommended Incoterms for Your Scenario" as title.
- **AC-002:** Primary recommendation shown prominently at top:
  - Incoterm code (large)
  - Full name
  - "Best Match" badge
  - Match percentage or score (e.g., "95% match")
  - Brief explanation of why it's recommended
- **AC-003:** Alternative recommendations (1-2) shown below with:
  - Incoterm code
  - Full name
  - Match percentage
  - One-line reason for recommendation
- **AC-004:** "Your Answers" summary section shows the choices user made.
- **AC-005:** "Learn More" button for each recommended Incoterm links to detail page.
- **AC-006:** "Start Over" button to retake the wizard.

---

## UI Behavior

- **AC-007:** Clicking "Learn More" navigates to that Incoterm's detail page.
- **AC-008:** Clicking "Start Over" clears wizard state and returns to wizard start.
- **AC-009:** Results page URL is shareable (encodes answers in query params).
- **AC-010:** Clicking on "Your Answers" summary expands to show full answers.

---

## Logic

- **AC-011:** Recommendations are calculated based on scoring algorithm:
  - Each Incoterm has attributes matching question options
  - Score = sum of matching attributes
  - Highest scoring Incoterm is primary recommendation
- **AC-012:** If multiple Incoterms tie, show all as alternatives.
- **AC-013:** If no strong match (all scores low), show educational message suggesting to learn more first.
- **AC-014:** "Not sure" answers reduce confidence but don't eliminate Incoterms.

---

## Special Notes

- **AC-015:** Disclaimer: "This is educational guidance only. Consult with trade professionals for actual transactions."
- **AC-016:** Include "Compare These" button to jump to comparison with recommended Incoterms pre-selected.
- **AC-017:** Celebration animation on primary recommendation (subtle confetti or highlight effect).

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-001:** Results calculate and display within 500ms of completing wizard.
- **NFR-002:** Results page is SEO-indexable for common scenarios.
