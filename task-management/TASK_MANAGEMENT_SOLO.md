# Task Management - Solo Technical PM Approach

**Context:** Single technical product manager handling entire repo
**Goal:** Lightweight tracking with minimal overhead, maximum productivity

---

## 🎯 Simplified 3-Level System

### Level 1: What am I building? (Features)
**File:** `/specs/index.md` (already exists)

### Level 2: What am I working on now? (Current Focus)
**File:** `/task-management/NOW.md`

### Level 3: What's next? (Backlog)
**File:** `/task-management/BACKLOG.md`

That's it. Three files, simple updates, always know where you are.

---

## 📋 Level 1: Feature Index (Enhanced)

**File:** `/specs/index.md`

**Keep it simple - just add Priority:**

```markdown
# Feature Index

## Active Features

| Feature | PRD | USM | USL | USD | UAT | Priority | Status |
|---------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|----------|--------|
| shipment-overview | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | 🚧 | ⏳ | P0 | Working on USD |
| booking-flow | ✅ | 🚧 | ⏳ | ⏳ | ⏳ | P1 | Planning |

## Completed Features

| Feature | Completed | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| - | - | - |

---

**Priorities:**
- **P0:** Working on now
- **P1:** Next up
- **P2:** Soon
- **P3:** Someday/Maybe

**Statuses:**
- Discovery
- Planning (PRD/USM/USL)
- Detailing (USD/UAT)
- Designing
- Building
- Testing
- Done
```

---

## 🎯 Level 2: NOW.md - Current Focus

**File:** `/task-management/NOW.md`

**Purpose:** Single source of truth for "what I'm working on right now"

**Format:**

```markdown
# What I'm Working On Now

*Last updated: 2025-01-15*

## 🎯 Current Focus

**Feature:** Shipment Overview - Basic Dashboard
**Stage:** Building (USD/UAT complete, implementing ST-001 to ST-004)

### This Week
- [x] Complete ST-001: Open Shipment Overview page
- [x] Complete ST-002: See list of upcoming departures
- [ ] Complete ST-003: Sort and filter shipments (70% done)
- [ ] Complete ST-004: View shipment details

**Blockers:**
- None currently

**Notes:**
- API integration took longer than expected (added 3h)
- Filter UI needs design decision: dropdown vs. inline filters (chose dropdown)

---

## 📝 Today (2025-01-15)

### Done
- ✅ Finished table pagination logic
- ✅ Added API endpoint for filters
- ✅ Wrote unit tests for ShipmentTable component

### In Progress
- 🚧 Implementing filter dropdown UI (2h remaining)

### Next
- ⏳ Wire filters to API
- ⏳ Add loading states

---

## 🔜 This Month (January 2025)

- [ ] Complete Shipment Overview MVP (ST-001 to ST-008)
- [ ] QA and deploy to staging
- [ ] Start Booking Flow discovery and PRD

---

## 💡 Ideas / Quick Notes

- Consider adding export to CSV feature (add to backlog as P2)
- User feedback: Need mobile view (add to P1)
- Tech debt: Refactor auth middleware (schedule for Feb)

---

*Prioritized list of features, improvements, and ideas*

---

## P0 - Working On Now

**Shipment Overview - Basic Dashboard**
- Status: 🚧 Building (ST-003 in progress)
- PRD: `/specs/shipment-overview/prd.md`
- Stories: 8 total (2 done, 1 in progress, 5 todo)
- Target: Jan 2025

---

## P1 - Next Up (This Quarter)

- Status: Idea
- Why: Expand to APAC markets
- Effort: ~2 weeks
- Complexity: Needs translation service

### Analytics Dashboard
- Status: Idea
- Why: Users want shipment metrics
- Effort: ~3 weeks

---

## 🔧 Technical Debt

- Refactor auth middleware (2 days, blocking security improvements)
- Update deprecated API endpoints (3 days, low priority)
- Add integration tests (ongoing, 1h per feature)
- Database query optimization (1 week, do before 1000+ users)

---

## 🐛 Known Issues (Not Blocking)

- BUG-001: Filter date range UI glitchy on Safari (P2)
- BUG-002: Export CSV slow for >500 rows (P3)

---

## 💡 Ideas Parking Lot

*Capture here, refine later*

- Real-time shipment tracking on map
- Integrate with carrier APIs directly
- Customer portal (separate from forwarder portal)
- Slack notifications
- API for third-party integrations
- Audit log for all changes
```

**Why this works:**
- ✅ Everything in one place
- ✅ Clear priorities
- ✅ Easy to reprioritize
- ✅ Capture ideas without committing
- ✅ Review weekly, update monthly

---

## 🔄 Simple Workflow

### Daily (2-3 minutes)
```bash
# Morning: Check NOW.md
cat task-management/NOW.md
# See what you're working on today

# Evening: Update NOW.md
# - Mark tasks done
# - Note blockers
# - Plan tomorrow
```

### Weekly (10-15 minutes)
```bash
# Review progress
# - Update NOW.md "This Week" section
# - Update /specs/index.md if stage changed
# - Review BACKLOG.md priorities
# - Move completed items to "Done"
```

### Monthly (30 minutes)
```bash
# Strategic review
# - Update task-management/BACKLOG.md priorities
# - Archive old notes from NOW.md to task-management/archive/
# - Review /specs/index.md for completed features
# - Plan next month's focus
```

**That's it.** Three tracking files, minimal overhead.

---

## 🎯 Comparison: Complex vs. Simple

### ❌ What We're NOT Doing (Overkill for Solo)
- ~~Sprint planning~~
- ~~Daily standup tracking~~
- ~~Sprint retrospectives~~
- ~~Team velocity metrics~~
- ~~Owner assignments~~
- ~~Detailed task breakdowns (unless you want them)~~
- ~~Weekly reports for stakeholders~~

### ✅ What We ARE Doing (Right-Sized)
- ✅ Feature status at a glance
- ✅ Current focus visible
- ✅ Prioritized backlog
- ✅ Quick daily updates
- ✅ Ideas captured
- ✅ Blockers noted

---

## 🛠️ Optional: Feature-Level Tasks

**If you want task breakdowns** for a feature, add this **optionally**:

**File:** `/specs/shipment-overview/TASKS.md`

```markdown
# Tasks: Shipment Overview

## ST-001: Open Shipment Overview Page ✅
- [x] Create component (2h)
- [x] Add route (1h)
- [x] Add nav item (1h)
- [x] Tests (2h)

## ST-002: List Upcoming Departures ✅
- [x] Table component (4h)
- [x] API endpoint (3h)
- [x] Integration (2h)
- [x] Pagination (3h)
- [x] Tests (3h)

## ST-003: Sort and Filter 🚧
- [x] Design filter UI
- [x] Implement dropdowns (4h)
- [ ] Wire to API (2h) ← YOU ARE HERE
- [ ] URL params (2h)
- [ ] Tests (3h)
```

**But you don't need this if NOW.md is enough.**

---

## 🚀 Implementation Plan

If you approve, I'll create:

### Minimal Setup (15 minutes)
1. Create `/task-management/NOW.md` with current state
2. Create `/task-management/BACKLOG.md` with sample priorities
3. Enhance `/specs/index.md` with Priority column
4. Create `/task-management/archive/` directory

### Optional (10 minutes)
5. Create sample `TASKS.md` for one feature (if you want task breakdowns)
6. Create update script (if you want automation)

---

## 💡 My Recommendation for You

**Start with:**
- ✅ `/task-management/NOW.md` - Update daily (2 min)
- ✅ `/task-management/BACKLOG.md` - Review weekly (10 min)
- ✅ `/specs/index.md` - Update when stage changes

**Skip:**
- ⏸️ Feature-level `TASKS.md` (add only if you want more granularity)
- ⏸️ Automation scripts (add when manual process is annoying)
- ⏸️ Metrics tracking (you're solo, you know how fast you're going)

**Rule of thumb:** If it takes more than 5 minutes to update tracking, it's too complex for solo work.

---

## ❓ Questions for You

1. **Does this simplified approach work for you?**
   - Or still too much process?

2. **Do you want feature-level task breakdowns** (TASKS.md)?
   - Or is NOW.md enough?

3. **How do you currently track what you're working on?**
   - Notepad? Sticky notes? Mental model?
   - I can adapt to your existing style

4. **Archiving:** Should old NOW.md content be archived monthly?
   - Or just overwrite?

---

## 🎯 Quick Decision Matrix

**Choose your tracking level:**

| Your Style | Use This |
|------------|----------|
| "I just need to remember what I'm doing" | NOW.md only |
| "I want to see feature progress" | NOW.md + specs/index.md |
| "I need to prioritize multiple features" | NOW.md + BACKLOG.md + specs/index.md |
| "I want detailed task tracking" | Add TASKS.md per feature |

**My guess for you:** NOW.md + BACKLOG.md + specs/index.md (the full simple setup)

---

**Should I proceed with the minimal setup? Any tweaks needed?**
